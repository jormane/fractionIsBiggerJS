// Created a function that quickly tells me what fraction is bigger, so I can ask it things like, "Which is bigger; three over four or five over seven?" 

function findBiggestFraction(a,b) {
    let result;
    a>b ? result = ["firstFraction", a] : result = ["secondFraction", b];
    return result;
}

let firstFraction = 3/4;
let secondFraction = 5/7;

let fractionResult = findBiggestFraction(firstFraction,secondFraction);

console.log("First fraction result: ", firstFraction);
console.log("Second fraction result: ", secondFraction);
console.log("Fraction " + fractionResult[0] + " with a value of " + fractionResult[1] + " is the biggest!");
